# Phase_hybrid_from_RADseq
Have you got a hybrid in your RADseq dataset, and you want to confirm its parent species? Then boy, do I have the pipeline for you! This pipeline was originally developed for (relatively) limited numbers of UCE loci, so I am in the process of tweaking it to work for larger numbers of loci from RADseq datasets.

There are two sets of scripts to help with this:

The first step is in the folder phasing_step. There is a readme in that folder to help with those.

The second step is in the folder post-processing. There is also a readme in there to help you too!
